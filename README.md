<p>

My interest in Information technology started relatively later than most people. My first experience with anything related to IT was undertaking the subject Computing in year 10. Unfortunately, I would not develop an interest until year 12. My interests for Information technology grew when I had my school laptop fixed by the IT department in my school, thus helping me realise that my interests in Information technology revolves around making the lives of people easier when it comes to technology. I am also interested in learning about computers as IT is a growing part of society.

I chose to come to RMIT as it is a respected university when it comes to Information technology. Also, the environment of RMIT seemed inviting as it is located in the city with a large support network. The clubs offered at RMIT, including the Islamic society which encouraged me to be a part of RMIT as I made new friends. The flexible timetables were also impressive to me and was a factor in choosing the Royal Melbourne Institution of Technology.

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">PERSONAL PROFILE</h1>

<h2 style="font-size:15px;">-The results of an online Myers-Briggs test: </h2>

<h3 style="font-size:15px;">RESULTS:</h3>

<h3 style="font-size:15px;">CREATIVITY TEST RESULTS:</h3>

<img src="ss_8.jpg" width="400" height="300"> 

<h2 style="font-size:15px;">-What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>

<p>

The results for the Myers-Briggs test were that I’m an adventurer, this indicates to me that my personality is someone who is more of an introvert. I am also 60% observant compared to being intuitive. I am 74% prospecting compared to judging. Being introverted suggests that I would benefit from a job with less people to communicate with and rely on to complete important tasks. Being observant and prospecting would allow me to correctly identify someone who is competent enough to work with. The results for the preferred learning style was auditory compared to other techniques such as visual and tactile. For my learning style to be auditory, it would be a fair assumption that learning in general would be best to hear lectures or having concepts explained by a teacher rather than reading information myself. In a work environment, especially job related to information technology where it would be best suited for instructions to be explained by a boss. Lastly, the results for the creativity test ended up producing a score of 54.32 with an average score of 63.01. My strengths include being able to change my perspectives in different scenarios as well as working on anything without any context. This will be suitable for a job situation as I will be flexible with adjusting to co-workers and being motivated to continue working on any task. CRITQUE: the validity of the overall results is debatable as there are many websites that can produce different results for the Myers-Briggs test. However, there are numerous different results with their own detailed description which suggests that the results are reliable. The learning style test is valid to an extend as there are only three options available them being auditory, visual and tactile. Thus, the results range is very limited in comparison to the Myers-Briggs and creativity score. The creativity score can be considered valid compared to the learning style test as there are around eight different attributes to be assessed on and it gives data compared to the other test. The score is valid as there is a mean score to compare it against. Overall judgement would be that the Myers-Briggs test and the creativity test can be valid compared to the learning style test.

</p>

<h2 style="font-size:15px;">
-How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
</h2>

<p>

The Myers-Briggs test results of having the personality trait of an adventurer leads to someone who is open to understand people but is an introvert. Being in a team situation would suggest that I would be open to other people’s ideas in the group. However, it also suggests that working with other people may be difficult and could lead to communication issues in a team. The learning style test suggests the best learning strategy is auditory. In a group scenario, it would be best if a team member can tell me the instructions for any tasks and explain it while talking for efficiency. Lastly the creative test results lean towards shifting people’s perspectives on something as well as accepting others and ideas as they are told. This is beneficial in a team setting as it will be easier to communicate with other people in a team and completing tasks with them.

</p>

<h2 style="font-size:15px;">
-How should you take this into account when forming a team?
</h2>

<p>

All the results can be taken into account when forming a team as it would be suitable to be paired with people who are extroverted and can voice their opinions freely. Specifically, team members who can provide easy instructions and explain concepts of tasks that need to be completed. It is important that other members are extroverted so it’s easier to communicate with each other to avoid issues.

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">PROJECT IDEA</h1>

<h3 style="color:purple;">Overview:</h3>

<p>

The motivation for the app is to allow people to function efficiently in their everyday life. More specifically, people can utilize the application to their advantage. They can facilitate this through discussing any problems they feel comfortable with that is impacting their personal life. According to recent statistics, 1 in 5 employed adults in the US experience mental health issues including depression (Wisner, 2019). Thus, proving people do think having mental health issues is impacting their work life and that the application will be useful. Overall, the app helping individuals with personal issues regarding their mental health will accomplish the ability for them to manage their lives effectively from the application. Also, Depression is affecting almost 350 million people worldwide (Wisner, 2019). Thus, the motivation of the application being created is to help manage and raise awareness for mental health issues as almost ‘350 million people’ are impacted.

</p>

<h3 style="color:purple;">Description:</h3>



<p>

The application will be available on IOS and Android and will be called Online Therapist. The purpose of the app is to allow people to openly express any issues they have or if they are looking for advice. The user will be able to either speak using their microphones, or type. The user will first pick from a select few options regarding the type of problem they are experiencing. For example, these include mental health related problems, job or education issues, family problems, drug and alcohol abuse. Lastly, there will be a section called ‘other’ for users if their use of the app doesn’t relate to the other options. After either typing or speaking about their problems, the user will get generated advice offered by the app in text form. In addition, they will be offered other helpful resources such as helplines, websites from other companies to offer them direct help with any problems they may have which is the reason they are utilising the application. There will be a section in the application called ‘statistics’, the goal for this section is to raise awareness on important information regarding mental health, for example statistics such as around 1 in 2 Australians aged 16-85 had experienced a mental disorder during their lifetime (Australia’s health, 2020). The statistics will then be followed by numerous links leading towards Government websites with more detailed information the user may want to read through. Other features of the application include people who will use the application to choose between light and dark mode in order to allow the user to choose their own preferred layout of the application. Another feature for the application is to change languages, automated language will be English with around 30 languages. The language change will include the texts in the app, as well as choosing the language the advice is given. People will also be able to access helplines from around 10 countries around the world. Moreover, users will have the opportunity to have notifications from the app regarding new advice and or links. Users will also have the option to receive daily motivational quotes notification set to any time they please. The application will have advertisements, which people can skip after a period of time. They can also fully remove the advertisement pop-ups by paying a small fee, which is a part of the in-app purchases. For privacy and security reasons, users must make an account in order to discuss their problems and obtain advice. They are able to link their google and Facebook accounts, or simply create an account using a preferred email. Lastly, there will always be a monthly survey available for users inquiring about the app features and how to improve on them. The surveys will be utilized when making upcoming patches to fix bugs and issues in regard to the app performance. The app will need to have fast loading screens to allow the user experience to be enjoyable and less irritable.

</p>

<h3 style="color:purple;">Tools and Technologies:</h3>



<p>


Tools and technologies needed would be a software to start developing the application. This could be UI Bakery; this software allows people to easily build their applications. It is less time consuming than others as there is no coding involved to make the app. However, you need a subscription in order to access full benefits of the software. Other hardware needed will be a computer with internet to access UI Bakery, as well as information regarding the links for articles and statistics. Also researching the different helplines around 10 different countries for users to access. hello

</p>

<h3 style="color:purple;">Skills Requried:</h3>



<p>


Skills needed to make the application would be determination as it takes time to research and develop the app. Being able to code is not necessary if UI Bakery is being utilized which is more appropriate for mobile apps. You need to be able to afford the software in order to make the application. Another skill needed is creativity when choosing font and colour designs, as well as section placements to catch the user’s attention in utilizing all the aspects of the app. It is possible to hire someone to make the application if you do not have the needed skills to operate the software and computer which will be used to access the software UI Bakery.

</p>

<h3 style="color:purple;">Outcome:</h3>



<p>

If the project is successful, the outcome would be that people will have an easily accessible application that will help with any issues they are encountering and is negatively impacting their lives.
